# Feature Update: Tabs, Dark Mode, Speedometer!

I have implemented all the requested features:
1.  **Bottom Navigation Bar**: You can now switch between "Map" and "Settings".
2.  **Settings Screen**: A clean interface to manage your app.
3.  **Dark Mode Toggle**: Go to Settings -> Appearance and flip the switch!
    *   The app changes colors (Background, Text, Cards).
    *   The **Map** gets a "dark overlay" to be easier on the eyes at night.
4.  **Speedometer**: On the map, you now have a real-time GPS Speedometer (km/h).
