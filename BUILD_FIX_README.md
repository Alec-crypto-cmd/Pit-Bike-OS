# Navigation Update

I have added a **Search Bar** to the top of the map.
You can now type a destination (e.g., "Berlin Alexanderplatz") and press "Go".
The app will find the location and draw a route from your position to it.

I also fixed the map file which was briefly corrupted in the previous step.

## Action Required
Push the changes to GitHub to build the updated APK.
