# Map Style Update - Back to OSM

You mentioned the map was "all yellow". This happens with Google Maps tiles sometimes if the API key is missing or restricted (even though we used a public tile URL).

I have switched **BACK to OpenStreetMap** (Standard).
This will definitely work and has the "normal" look with roads, green parks, and blue water - not just yellow.
