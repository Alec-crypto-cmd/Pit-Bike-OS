# Map Detail Update

I encountered a glitch applying the detailed map style previously. I have now fixed it.
The map will now show full OpenStreetMap details including streets, buildings, and village names.

## Action Required
Please run your `.bat` script again (or push manually) to trigger the build.

```bash
Git push.bat
```
